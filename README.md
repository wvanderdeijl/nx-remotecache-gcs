# nx-remotecache-gcs

A task runner for [Nx](https://nx.dev/) that uses a Google Cloud Storage bucket as a remote cache, so all team members and CI servers can share a single cache. The concept and benefits of [computation caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/cache-task-results) are explained in the NX documentation.

## setup

```
npm install --save-dev nx-remotecache-gcs
```

create a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Since this is only a cache, there is no need for a dual- or multi-region bucket, so choose a single [location](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations) near you.

```
gsutil mb -p [PROJECT_ID] -l [BUCKET_LOCATION] -b on gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/
```

setup a [lifecycle rule](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/managing-lifecycles) for your storage bucket to automatically delete old files. If you want to use our suggested auto-delete-after-30-days rule, you can simply use the json that is included:

```
gsutil lifecycle set node_modules/nx-remotecache-gcs/lifecycle.json gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
```

by default all viewers, editors and owners of your Google Cloud project can read and/or write to the bucket. You could also [restrict who can read and write](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/using-iam-permissions) the bucket to only allow certain users or (build server) service accounts.

finally, add `tasksRunnerOptions` in your `nx.json` file

```json
{
    "projects": {
        ...
    },
    "tasksRunnerOptions": {
        "default": {
            "runner": "nx-remotecache-gcs",
            "options": {
                "bucket": "gs://NAME-OF-YOUR-STORAGE-BUCKET",
                "cacheableOperations": [
                    "build",
                    "test",
                    "lint",
                    "e2e"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}

```

run a build and see if files end up in your cache storage bucket:

```
nx run-many --target=build --all
```

## Options

Use NX_SKIP_REMOTE_CACHE environment variable for temporary disabling remote cache, while keeping the local cache in tact.
This can be beneficial for some CI cases you want to run without using the remote cache.

```
export NX_SKIP_REMOTE_CACHE=true
nx run project:target
```

```
NX_SKIP_REMOTE_CACHE=true nx run project:target
```
